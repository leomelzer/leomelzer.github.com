Don't expect Tips **against** your Procrastination. Instead I'll provide you with some ideas on what to procrastinate with. ~

This is my personal **List of Shame** with things I did in the last week in order not to work and actually learn for that last exam which is coming up rather soon.

So here you go, in no particular order:

1. Update Software on all available Devices.
2. Clean up *Documents* Folder.
3. Check HackerNews, open a couple tabs, get lost in the interwebs.
4. Tag unnamed faces in iPhoto (holy crap, I have 11.417 unnamed faces left, might have to come back to this one).
5. Shop for new Music, which you believe may make you work more efficiently, on Amazon MP3.
6. Browse the *Productivity* Category in the AppStore. Figure to get nothing new.
7. Go to the grocery shop.
8. Invite friends for dinner and cook.
9. Again: Check HackerNews and open tabs, get lost - this is just too easy.
10. Watch a week worth of *The Daily Show* episodes (5 times 21 minutes = 105 minutes).
11. Check activity on all your bank accounts.
12. Check your monthly spendings and find ways to save up (actually not that senseless).
13. Clear out your clothes.
14. Review privacy settings on Facebook.
15. Accidentally (you may also do this on purpose) smash the glass inset of a door, take care of glass splinters, organizing the repair and insurance.
16. Do sports.
17. Sell stuff on eBay (btw: [My 24" iMac is on sale](http://cgi.ebay.de/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=300606366534#ht_500wt_902)).
18. Check your backup-strategy, on all devices.
19. Clear out your clothes, a second time because this actually is not that easy.
20. Write a blog post on your own ways to procrastinate.

Hope you found some inspiration, you may also print this list and check items one by one as you work your way through.

And please, share your ways to procrastinate in the comments. I'd love to know more.

**Great: with that out of the way, let's do some real work now!**
