I'm not sure when, but quite some time ago I started to write down slogans. Short sentences, lyrics & quotes that inspired me, that have a meaning to me.

Maybe it's part of the geek in me but I always felt like they would do great on T-Shirts. I'm big on typography and minimal design but the list also includes some links to geo-related infographics.
At first I stored this list in SimpleNote. Then In Taskpaper. A few days it struck me while marvelling about the usefulness of `git`: the only place this should be is in the public, easily shareable. So today I put this list in a Gist on @gitub, where it should have been all along.

So what know? Currently I'm too busy to check for great printing options (high-quality shirts, proven printing method, eco-friendly, fair-trade...) but I might use this as an excuse for some procrastination sometime soon, ha!

If you happen to have good experiences with printing shops please let me know. Oh, and I'm no designer - so if you feel like helping out on this end, you are more than welcome.

This reminds me, I should clean out my wardrobe this week.
