Around one year ago in March 2010 I finished a Tetra Pak of delicious orange juice. When trying to get the last portion out of the packaging I realized something and went on to the following...

Looking at the pictures today makes me chuckle. Still, I like the idea. In the endless shelves with tetra pak's all looking the same making up a solid surface of indistinguishable products, this small touch would draw the potential customers' attention. Pair that with a nifty marketing slogan and boom.

The quality of the juice will always stay the most important aspect - but you got to sell it well. And the only thing the customer sees in the context of a supermarket is in fact, the packaging.
