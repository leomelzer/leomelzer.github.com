Running Code. So here it finally is, a place for myself. A place to get myself to write texts longer than 140 characters.
An effort to get myself to use the commandline including git & vim more often. 
I don't know where this is heading to: I imagine this to be a supplement to [www.foomoo.de](http://www.foomoo.de "my personal website") - stay tuned, all-new somewhen soon.
If you feel like, chim in via Disqus. Thanks to toto by @cloudhead for making this such a nobrainer. Oh, and @heroku - you're great.

So what is the name *Running Code* about? Last year during a lecture in University our Professor introduced us to the concepts of the interweb, its technical foundation and best-effort princicple.
Then he had this quote on the slides:

> We reject kings, presidents and voting. We believe in rough consensus and running code.
> **Dave Clark (IETF T-shirt, 1992)**

Somehow this stuck with me, I like the notion.
Oh, and I like Code. And I do enjoy running. So there you have it, Running Code.
*Welcome.*
